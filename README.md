Network Simulation Lab Report – GNS3

Course: Introduction to Cybersecurity
Institution: Marian College Kuttikanam (ICTAK Paatshala)
Topic: Getting Started with Network Simulations using GNS3 (Beginner – No Routers)
Student Name: Jom Joseph
Date: 17/11/2025



Objective

The purpose of this lab was to understand basic network simulation using GNS3 in a virtual environment, create simple switch-based topologies, test connectivity, and document the results using GitHub for submission.



Tools & Environment

Operating System: Ubuntu

Simulation Software: GNS3 (GUI + Local server)

Devices Used: VPCS (virtual PCs), Ethernet switches

Version Control & Submission: GitHub (public repository)




Tasks Completed

Part A – Installation

✔ Installed GNS3 on Ubuntu
✔ Verified GNS3 Local Server (green status)
✔ Captured installation screenshot

Part B – Network Topologies

1.	Topology 1 – Simple LAN

2 PCs, 1 Switch

Connected PCs through switch

Assigned IP addresses (same subnet)

Successful ping between PCs



2.	Topology 2 – Star Topology

4 PCs, 1 Switch

Central switch connected to all PCs

Assigned IP addresses

All devices successfully pinged



3.	Topology 3 – Multi-Switch Mesh

3 switches interconnected in loop

1 PC per switch

All PCs assigned IPs in same subnet

Verified full end-to-end connectivity






Part C – Project Export

All topologies exported as Portable Projects (.zip) using:

File → Export → Portable Project



Part D – GitHub Submission

Created a public repository named:
NetworkSimLab-YourName

Repository includes:

Exported project folders (.zip)

Screenshots of:

GNS3 installation

Topology diagrams

Ping test results


Summary report (this document)


GitHub URL submitted in ICTAK Paatshala.



Learning Outcomes

After completing this lab, I am able to: ✔ Install and configure GNS3 on Ubuntu
✔ Build basic LAN, star, and mesh switch-based network topologies
✔ Assign IP addresses and verify connectivity using ping
✔ Export GNS3 projects as portable packages
✔ Use GitHub for version control and documentation



Conclusion

This assignment provided hands-on experience working with network simulation tools and reinforced foundational networking concepts including switching, IP addressing, connectivity testing, and documentation. The activity also introduced an industry-standard workflow using GitHub for project submission and collaboration.
